# Data Analysis of the Iris Dataset

This repository contains a notebook that performs data analysis of the Iris dataset. The code addresses several questions and topics, including descriptive analysis, class distribution, correlation between traits, differentiation between species, and visualizations.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install them using `pip`:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
## How to use
Clone this repository to your local environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/ntsation/IrisML.git
```
Make sure the iris.csv file with the data is in the same directory as the notebook.

Here is the dataset link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris

Run the notebook:
```
irisML.ipynb
```

The code will perform descriptive, exploratory, and classification analysis of data from the Iris dataset, answer questions, and generate visualizations.

## Code Content
- **irisML.ipynb**: The complete notebook that performs data analysis and answers the proposed questions.
- **Results**:
Analysis results, including descriptive statistics, class distribution, correlations, visualizations, and species differentiation, will be displayed in the console.
